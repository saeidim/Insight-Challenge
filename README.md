Challenge: BlueMountain is a retailer whom we have been doing a 1 month pilot with them on their customer experience program. We have been helping measure the experience their customers have with them shopping in store. Now imagine we are now at the end of that 1 month pilot, and the customer success manager has asked for your assistance with preparing some insights to present to their key stakeholders from marketing.

Prepare a powerpoint presentation covering the below items. The data file attached is a combination of the survey responses with their structured customer data for transactions that occurred during September 2014:

Q1: Top 3 insights that their team can take away for making decisions/improvements to their business Q2: Outline a particular key trend you have uncovered in the data, that we should help them focus on over the next 6 months. Why should they focus on this, and what is the data/report supports it?
